# Contract-Demon-Vita
VPK and Livearea Assets for Contract Demon by NomnomNami (Ren'Py Port)

## An example of Ren'Py done as smoothly as possible
NomnomNami was one of the reasons the entire Ren'Py Port was deemed possible, as their Vita port of Syrup and the Ultimate Sweet (Available on the PlayStation Store) actually runs on a custom Ren'Py build. Their games all run extremely smoothly with the least amount of hitches so far and thanks to their small but still impactful influence on the project, I even became a Patreon. I'd recommend you do the same to support them. She puts a lot into these VNs just for fun.
